/// # The Pumpkin Prime Number Generator
///
/// The `pumpkin` prime number generator library can be used to generate
/// prime numbers of any reasonable length, suitable for any cryptographic
/// purpose. All numbers generated are seeded from the operating system's
/// secure source of entrophy and are verified using three different primality
/// tests.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```
/// extern crate pumpkin;
///
/// use pumpkin::Prime;
///
/// fn main() {
///     // Generate a 2048-bit prime number
///     let p = Prime::new(2048);
///     let q = Prime::new(2048);
///
///     let r = p * q;
///     println!("{}", r); // Some ridiculously large number
/// }
/// ```
